## Qualifications and Experience

  and weaknesses

## Working Groups

This candidate is nominated as a candidate to both the LSP and STP Working
Groups (LSP-WG, STP-WG).

## Proposition

My interest in the working groups is to see the long-term success of Scala's
tooling ecosystem, whatever form that may take. I have expertise with Scala,
but little experience specific to tooling, though I have worked with a number
of tools outside of Scala's mainstream, and I intende to push for inclusively
supporting a broad range of tools and approaches to solving tooling challenges.

I would see my role on the working groups as one of co-ordination and mediation
between proponents of different technologies, looking to add objectivity to a
debate where many people have already made significant investments in different
projects, and where some well-considered compromise may be necessary to achieve
the greatest level of success for Scala. I would devote time to both the social
and technical challenges of finding and exploiting common ground between
different tooling ideas.
