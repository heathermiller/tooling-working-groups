# Mads Hartmann

## Proposer

Nominated by Sam Halliday (@fommil) and seconded by Iulian DragoÈ™ (@dragos).

## Qualifications and Experience

- Worked together with Mirco Dotta and Iulian Dragos back in 2012 on
  [Scala Semantic Search][scala-semantic-search]. It never fully made it into
  Scala IDE for Eclipse (I think) but it did give me experience working with the
  Scala Presentation Compiler and an appreciation for the challenges that
  entails. Btw here's an [amazing demo][yes-that-took-6-months-to-build] of it ðŸ˜‰

- Wrote one of the [more popular][scala.tmbundle] Scala syntax highlighting
  definitions way back when I was using TextMate. I believe most editors
  indirectly use this definition for highlighting (don't quote me on that). I
  don't think it is directly relevant to the work we'll be doing in the LSP-WG
  but it has convinced me that you can only do such much with regular
  expressions before everything becomes one big mess ðŸ˜‰

## Affiliations

Employed by [Famly][famly].

## Working Groups

This candidate is nominated as a candidate to the LSP Working Group (LSP-WG).

## Proposition

I'm [really excited][200-word-limit-hack] by LSP. I love editors so much I'm at
a point where I use more than three on a any given day day. Please give me the
opportunity to at least help make sure my Scala experience is consistent
throughout the day.
