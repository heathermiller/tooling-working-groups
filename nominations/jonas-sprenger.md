## Proposition

I just started my developer career 2 months ago. Before, I was a technician in the aeronautical field.

Since I am passionate about IT, I am fascinated by development tools (text editor, IDE, ...) and conserned by their ergonomics.
I would like to be involved in the Scala community to make the developer experience even better.
